\noindent
The tables above show the number of certain kinds of edits from specific countries in all analyzed variants of Wikipedia. Countries are selected to have at least 100,000~vandalism edits in the COUNTRY_NAME Wikipedia, or that have COUNTRY_NAME as a major language (according to the English Wikipedia) and at least 1,000~vandalism edits. Countries are sorted by the number of all edits in the COUNTRY_NAME Wikipedia. The same countries are used in the hour-of-day plots.

Vandalism commented edits refers to edits that are---after filtering reverts---affected by a revert with a comment that signals that it is undoing vandalism (see Kittur et al. (2007b)). Note that this approach uses specific words to classify comments and is thus likely less effective in finding vandalism for other languages than English.

All plots show the ratio of vandalism to all edits per hour of day (left axis, solid lines), and for reference, the absolute number of edits (light gray) and vandalism edits (dark gray) per hour of day (right axis, dashed lines), both averaged over the COUNTRY_NAME Wikipedia's history. Ratios estimated from less than 1,000 vandalism edits are displayed with dotted lines.

The thin black line to the right is the vandalism ratio when detecting vandalism by comments of reverts (see Kittur et al. (2007b)). Note that this approach uses specific words to classify comments and is thus likely less effective in finding vandalism for other languages than English.
